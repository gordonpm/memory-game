## Instructions

You need to find matching cards in the deck. A move(turn) consists of clicking 2 cards. If both cards match, then they remain open otherwise they close. The game ends when all
matching cards are found. There is a counter for the number of moves and a rating which is based on the number of moves. The lesser the number of moves it takes to find all
matching cards, the higher the player's rating for the game. The player can restart the game if needed.


## Implementation

The game is implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are 3 files used one for the HTML which is index.html, one for the styling which is app.css and one for the 
Javascript code which is app.js.
